# Ubuntu for Xiaomi Pad 5 Pro
This repo contians **Base Guide for installation/upgrading** and **Scripts for automatic building of Ubuntu RootFS, Mainline Kernel, Firmware package, ALSA configs** for Xiaomi Pad 5 Pro

### [**Project status**](https://wiki-postmarketos-org.translate.goog/wiki/Xiaomi_Mi_Pad_5_Pro_(xiaomi-elish)?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=id&_x_tr_hl=id&_x_tr_pto=tc)

# Where do I get the needed files?
Just go to the "Actions" tab, open the latest build and download files named **rootfs_(Desktop Environment)_(Kernel version)** and **boot-xiaomi-elish_(Kernel version).img**
<br>For upgrading - download all available files, **except for rootfs**

## Upgrading steps (From running Ubuntu)
- Unpack all the .zip files you downloaded into one folder
- Open terminal and go to the folder where you unpacked all .zip files into
- Run "sudo dpkg -i *-xiaomi-elish.deb"
- If you use flashing instead of **fastboot boot**: flash a new boot image using "dd if="**path to boot.img**" of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/boot_**('a' or 'b')**"
- Reboot using new image

### Partitioning steps using "parted", where text inside () is a command to execute
⚠️**New partition should be at least 5GB in size for rootfs.img to fit in**
<br>⚠️**You will lose all your android data**
 - Download parted executable from the "Releases" tab
 - Reboot to TWRP recovery and push the downloaded file to /tmp <br>(**adb push parted /tmp**)
 - Access phone shell <br>(**adb shell**)
 - Grant execute permission and open parted for further steps<br>(**chmod +x /tmp/parted && /tmp/parted /dev/block/sda**)
 - Look at the partitions and remember "Number", "Start" "End" for "userdata" partition <br>(**print**)
 - Remove the "userdata" partition <br>(**rm "Number"**)
 - Create a new "userdata" partition <br>(**mkpart userdata f2fs "Start" "*End - size that you want to allocate for Ubuntu install*"**)
 - Create a new "linux" partition <br>(**mkpart linux ntfs "*End - size that you want to allocate for Ubuntu install*" "End"**)
 - Reboot back to recovery
 - Format the new "userdata" using TWRP format data function
 - Format the new "linux" partition <br>(**mkfs.ext4 /dev/block/by-name/linux**)
  
## Install steps
- You should have custom partitions, follow "Partitioning steps..."
- Unpack .zip files you downloaded
- Unpack extracted rootfs.7z
- rootfs.img must be flashed to the partition named "linux"
<br>⚠️**USE "dd if="path to rootfs.img" of=/dev/block/by-name/linux"
<br>  FLASHING USING FASTBOOT RESULTS IN BROKEN UBUNTU FILESYSTEM**
- Flash (or **fastboot boot**) boot.img that you got from boot archive

## Firmware and service requirements
This device requires Qualcomm DSP firmware (ADSP/CDSP/SLPI/venus) to be available in the
initramfs. The list of blobs expected by the initramfs is tracked in
`/usr/share/mkinitfs/files/30-dsp-firmware.files` inside the firmware package.

When building a custom initramfs, make sure to include the following modules early so the
DSPs and touchscreen can initialize (mirrors the postmarketOS modules-initfs list):
`nt36523_ts`, `panel-novatek-nt36523`, `qcom_common`, `qcom_pil_info`, `qcom_q6v5`,
`qcom_q6v5_pas`, and `spi-geni-qcom`.

No special kernel cmdline parameters are required beyond your usual boot arguments. If you
override the cmdline, keep it minimal (for example `quiet`) to avoid disabling QRTR/RMTFS
services that rely on the platform drivers loading normally.
